# Java-Neural-Network

Simple Neural Network made in Java for learning purposes. Inspired by https://github.com/CodingTrain/Toy-Neural-Network-JS

The code includes commented out XOR problem, and MNIST handwritten digit recognition in Main file. Code is not refactored, just simple write-run. It does not include mnist files, if you want to run the reader you need to download and unpack them yourself.
